# Sandbox for Exploring, Experimenting

_Learning happens in the lab, not the lecture hall._

This repo is where I figure out how stuff works (and prepare other labs to help
others figure stuff out as well). I decided to combine all the languages and
technologies into one `lab` repo since they all cross-over so much.
